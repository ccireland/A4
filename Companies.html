    <h1><center>The Companies Side</center></h1>
    <hr>

    <p>As technology has become more and more prevalent and people have been growing their online presence this opens the door for all kinds of advertising. From pop-ups to roadblocks to tickers advertisements find their way into our everyday life in as many ways possible. One of the biggest ways ads reach consumers is through social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube. Consumers use these platforms for entertainment, communication, and keeping up with others almost every single day. This presents a large space that the companies can sell to advertisements. Some companies like Facebook even have sections in their financial reports that tell how much money they make per user. This past quarter Facebooks annual revenue per user (ARPU) was $7.26. This basically shows the percentage of the profits that Facebook is making off of ads per person Advertising has become a huge part of our daily lives and we may not see the companies side of ads and how they can use them to make their products better for the consumer.</p>

    <p>The first and possibly most obvious reason that companies use ads on their social media sites is so that they can make money. This is true and is the whole reason why companies use ads. What you may not realize is that to make the product free like Snapchat or Instagram there will always need to be ads. Without having the ads on these mediums, then companies would likely go out of business or be forced to charge a monthly fee in order to use their product. This makes you think if Facebook makes $7.26 per user, then they could easily charge that as a monthly fee in order to have an Facebook account. Companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat all make money off of ads so that they do not need to charge you a monthly subscription fee for their services.</p>

    <p>Now that we know why companies use ads we can look at why ad space on these social media sites can go for so much money. When a company chooses to spend money and advertise their product on Facebook or Instagram they want to make sure that their ad ends up being viewed by the right people. For example, if a Women's hair brush company advertises their newest brush on a social media site they don't want 70-year-old bald men to be seeing this add per say. This is where the concept of targeted ads comes in. The social media sites track your clicks and what you like and with complicated algorithms are able to show you ads that are usually more relevant to you. This means that the ads you see you are more likely to buy the product because it actually interests you. Now as a consumer you may look at this and say I don't want Facebook to be tracking me and seeing what I like or dislike. This is very true and web privacy is another topic. If you look at this problem from the other side, you can see why people may like to have targeted ads. For example, if you are a 25 year old single male who loves working on cars would you rather see ads on new cars or car tools for sale or women's makeup products. I think that most people would like to see ads that are somewhat relevant to their own life rather than completely random ads.</p>

    <p>Since these companies make so much money from advertisements they gain a lot of control of how much they actually make as well as the ability to control a social and business aspect of the marketplace. If Facebook is having a bad quarter nothing is stopping them from boosting the number of ads its users see in order to increase their revenues. This poses the question of why don't companies use more and more ads to just make more and more money. I think that can be broken down into two parts. The first part is that some companies have ethics and are able to tell when they are showing too many ads. The second part is that companies need to find the right balance of ads and content for their users. If Instagram only showed 1 ad every timer a user logged into the app they would lose considerable amounts of money due to the lost ad revenue. On the other side if Instagram showed more ads than content to users, users would be less likely to return to the app because they don't only want to see ads when they log on. Finding this balance is key for the companies to make money but also retain their users and gain more in the future. This balance however can be manipulated slightly to boost quarterly numbers if needed. Another aspect of companies controlling ads on their product is the social control they have. What I mean by this is if a social media site decides to block or allow certain things this can change how customers view that social media site. Recently Twitter announced that it would be banning all political ads on their site due to the fact that they can't control what the politicians pay for. Twitter also stated that they do not have the resources to check that all of the ads are 100% legitimate. This caused a few things to happen between the big social media sites. Twitter took a stance standing against fake news and this puts pressure on sites like Facebook who haven't blocked political ads. Facebook can either follow suit or stay the way that they are. Twitter is also taking a financial risk by doing this because they are blocking a large portion of ad revenue around election time. Twitters hope is that they can bring in more users from Facebook and Instagram in order to make up for the lost revenue by not having the political ads.</p>

    <p>At the end of the day these social media companies are business' trying to succeed, and to do that they need to make money. One of the biggest ways that they make their money is through advertising to their users. This causes some controversy with targeting ads or just too many ads, but most companies do care about their users because they are the ones that make them their money. Companies are always trying to find that balance between making money and keeping users happy.</p>
