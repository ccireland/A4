      <p>Now that social media plays a large part in a lot of people's daily lives we start to see a lot of ads. These ads come in all shapes and sizes, some are helpful, some are just annoying. This brings up the questions about do we see too many ads on a daily basis? Do companies care about how many ads we actually see, or do they just want to get as much money from ads as they can? Are there actually too many ads or do they just get annoying? As technology grows and more and more people use social media ads become inevitable.</p>

      <p>Like I talked about on the company side of things, at the core these social media companies are business and business need to make money to stay in business. One of their main sources of revenue comes from companies paying them to advertise on their site. Companies pay to put their ads on these social media sites because they know that they will be seen by the right audience. "The right audience" is what makes things tricky when it comes to advertising. What I mean by this is that when you search the web google or other sites are tracking your clicks to see what you like. Then their algorithms are grouping you into categories that it thinks you fit in. Once the sites have you somewhat figured out they can begin to show you ads that they think you will like in hopes that they can get a sale of the product. This brings up a debate on whether or not companies like google and Facebook should be able to track us online. The other side to this that some people are unaware of is that targeted ads are not always a bad thing. When you go on to your favorite social media site and you see ads on there the ads usually are about something that you want need or enjoy. This can be helpful because the site does the filtering for you. If you are a teenage guy who likes to fish, you do not need to see ads about Barbie dolls because that won't interest you and you will probably never buy one. This is a hot debate when it comes to privacy on the internet because there are two strong sides as well as a lot of different solutions or changes. Some easy solutions that you can take are to use search engines like DuckDuckGo. If you do not want to see ads at all you can install ad blockers that will prevent ads from popping up on most sites. </p>

      <p>Another big thing about social media companies making money from ads is that it makes the social media sites free to use. Since companies are paying Facebook and Instagram to put their ads on them, Facebook and Instagram and other social media sites are able to make their product free to the public. I think a lot of consumers don't realize this or they take this for granted. The tradeoff of seeing an ad every few posts keeps you from having a monthly fee associated with the site. This would be easy for companies to implement. Facebook and other companies already have categories of their financial statements about the average revenue per user. This number comes mainly from the money they are making with ads. Facebook makes $7.26 per user and they could easily charge customers $8 or more for a Facebook subscription. The same applies to all your favorite social media sites, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube. One solution that can fit the need of different type of people is to have a free version with ads and some limited capabilities, and a subscription version that users pay for that has no ads and a few premium features. This fits both sides of the market because people who don't want to spend money can use the free version and people who don't want ads can spend money to avoid them. Some popular news companies do this with their online news sources and it seems to work well. There is no perfect solution however because someone will always want something different. Therefore, it is up to the companies to listen to user's feedback and make decisions that better the company and their product.</p>

      <p>Overall ads on our favorite social media sites can get annoying because it seems like there are so many of them. They pop up everywhere and seem to be listening to us. This is something that is not completely out of our control. Companies listen to feedback about their product because it is how they make money, but also at the end of the day they still need the ads to make money. The companies have a couple options to make people happier as well as us as consumers can do things to make our social media experience a little more enjoyable. Companies could change the structure of their product to a free version with ads and a paid version without ads. This creates a happy medium and users can choose to pay or not. Also, as consumers we can use browsers that don't track your clicks, so you don't get weirdly specific ads. There are also ad blockers that can be installed to block the sight of most ads. Advertisements are an inevitable portion of social media because the companies need to make money, but I hope you are more informed on why they do it and what you can do to change your outlook.</p>
